```
python files marked by `*` compose the pipeline for video processing, other python files are calibration or util files.
Please refer to documentations in the codes for more details

### How to run the code
To run this pipeline, use the following command from the root directory
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python line_finder/workflow.py
```
(to process the challenge video, uncomment Line #374 and #388 of `line_finder/workflow.py` )

Most python files support
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python folder/filename.py
```
which either run their `main()` method if the file is supposed to be run once to get calibration result, or `test_XXX` method as a unit test, if the file serve as part of the pipeline

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

##### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in `camera_calibration/camera_calibration.py`).  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `obj_point` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `obj_points` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `img_points` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `obj_points` and `img_points` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:
![alt text][image2]

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (funciton `threshold_pipeline()` in `line_finder/thresholding.py`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

![alt text][image3]

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes in functions `main()` and `generate_matrix()` in the file `line_finder/generate_perspective_matrix.py` The `generate_matrix()` function takes as inputs source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points:

```python
src = np.float32([[195, height], [593, 450], [689, 450], [1125, height]])
dst = np.float32([[315, height], [315, 0], [965, 0], [965, height]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 195, 720      | 315, 720      |
| 593, 450      | 315, 0        | 
| 689, 450      | 965, 0        |
| 1125, 720     | 965, 720      |


I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

The `perspective matrix` and `inverse perspective matrix` were stored in pickle files. A class called `TransformPerspective` in the file `line_finder/transform_perspective.py` reads them back from the pickle file and applies the perspective transformation for the lane identfication pipeline.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines #268 through #273 in my code in `line_finder/workflow.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in `Lane.visualize()` in `line_finder/workflow.py`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?
Identifying the optimized combinations of channels, gradients and thresholds to filter image is the crucial and hardest part of this project. To simplify this work, I created `Module` and `ImageList` classes (in `line_finder/thresholding.py`) to reduce the amount of boilerplate codes and help with the visualization. Further, to fine tune the thresholds, I created GUI with sliding bars (in `line_finder/module_gui.py`). I also refactored the `workflow` a lot so that the thresholding part can be plugged as a seperate function into the pipeline instead of tightly coupled with other part of the pipeline.

I have to use different thresholding functions to process different videos: `threshold_pipeline` and `challenge_threshold_pipeline` (in `line_finder/thresholding.py`) for `project_video` and `challenge_video` respectively. The exposure and other factors affect the thresholding, and cannot be easily removed using histogram equalization method such as CLAHE. This makes the pipeline not flexible enough to be used in real problems.

I used some tricks to make the pipeline more robust:
1. when a new line (left line or right line) is identified in an image frame, the best line (from previous image frames) is updated by this new line using a weight. This weight represents how confident we are in this new line, considering two aspects: A. left and right lines on the image shall be parallel to each other, B. the new line should not be too different from the previous line. 
2. when a new lane (left line and right line combination) is identified using sliding window with prior knowledge, we also consider two factors to decide how good it is, and if it is not good enough, we will discard the previous knowledge and find the lane line using sliding window from scratch. The two factors are: A. The two lines should be parallel to each other, B. the average distance between the two lines should be not too different from that measured in previous frames.

These tricks help with the `challenge_video` processing a lot, but it is still not optimal. There are several reasons:
1. Thresholding, even though optimized carefully, is not good enough. An optimized thresholding to identify lane lines in all frames of a video might simply not exist. Indeed, I could not find one for the `harder_challenge_video`. More advanced image processing techniques are needed, which might also help to address the next issue.
2. Not all the information is used. For example, lane lines are usually stripes with a constant width, consistent pixel values in y direction, opposite gradients on their edges in most case. Such information can help with excluding a lot of false positives. Also, in some extreme road and lightning conditions, the lane line might be impossible to identify, extrapolating the previous and later frames to find the lane lines are essential. My tricks covers a little about this, but did not fully utilize the information in the video streams.
3. Sliding window method is not an optimal method to identify lines. It is not very resilient to noise. More advanced line fitting techniques are needed.
